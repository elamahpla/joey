              This is the second iteration of a friend's website. She owns and operates the company Sweetest Southern Creations and wanted to have
              an online presence. So, I started by creating <a href="https://github.com/Joey-Robinson/SweetSouthernCreations">the first version of the website</a> which I was
              displeased with.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              Then, I created <a href="https://github.com/Joey-Robinson/SweetestSouthernCreations">the next version</a> of the website. This is the current 
              version which I will update when the assets are in hand.
